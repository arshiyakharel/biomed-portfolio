# Biomedical Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! This repository documents my journey in coding and CAD for biomedical device applications.

## 🌱 Focus Areas
- Medical device design and rapid prototyping
- Embedded systems for medical applications
- Coding with free, open-source languages (Python, Arduino)
- Arduino-based biomedical device prototypes
- CAD modeling with FreeCAD and other open-source software

## Projects
- Heart Rate Monitor 

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `/coding-projects` — Python scripts and analysis notebooks
- `/arduino-projects` — Embedded code for device prototypes
- `/cad-models` — CAD designs and exported files

## 👩‍🔬 About Me
I’m a recent Biomedical Engineering graduate building a public portfolio of employable skills learned independently and affordably. I hope to inspire other aspiring engineers to pursue valuable skills in medical technology without high costs.
